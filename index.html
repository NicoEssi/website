    <p>Quotes I often remind myself of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>True security lies in the unrestrained embrace of insecurity - in the recognition that we never really stand
            on solid ground, and never can. // Oliver Burkeman
        </li>
        <li>Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day
            into the answer. // Rainer Maria Rilke
        </li>
        <li>At some point in life the world’s beauty becomes enough. You don’t need to photograph, paint, or even
            remember it. It is enough. // Toni Morrison
        </li>
        <li>In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have
            learned to let go. // Jack Kornfield</li>
        <li>Above all, don’t lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point
            that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for
            others. And having no respect he ceases to love. // Fyodor Dostoyevsky</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Books I recommend:</p>

        <li>Enchiridion, by Epictetus</li>
        <li>Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius</li>
        <li>The Idiot, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</li>
        <li>On the Shortness of Life, by Seneca</li>
        <li>Brothers Karamazov, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</li>
        <li>The Master and Margarita, by Mikhail Bulgakov</li>
        <li>Four Thousand Weeks, by Oliver Burkeman</li>
        <li>Beyond Order, by Jordan B. Peterson</li>
        <li>Lying, by Sam Harris</li>
        <li>To Live, by Yu Hua</li>
    </ul>
